# Nightmares-Mod
Modifying Unity's 3D project to gain experience with the 3D engine.

A video of this project can be found at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9G1bO2otHI

This is a modification of Unity's open project that can be found at http://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/projects/survival-shooter along with tutorials on how to put it together.  Up to this point I have disabled the camera script and made the camera a part of the player object to make it first-person.  I have also added waves so the enemies slowly increase and the player gets a break between waves.  The amount of points per enemy killed increases each wave.  A nuke has also been added to get players out of tight situations.  The nuke cannot spawn more than once per wave. The nuke spawns once the amount of enemies on that are on the map at a given moment in time reaches a certain threshold.
